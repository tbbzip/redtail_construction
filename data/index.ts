        "We have 100 Redtail GPS devices and plan to buy more our company is growing, and as we acquire other businesses we plan to outfit those trucks as well. We especially appreciate the pricing flexibility of the various Redtail service plans. We chose five minute screenshots, which have a lower monthly rate than other GPS companies quoted. The Redtail customer service and tech support have been great, and we have achieved fuel savings. Weve had a very good experience with Redtail. ",

        "REDTAIL Telematics came to my attention in the very early days of Usage-Based Insurance when young driver coaching and their technology was used to help launch UBI pioneer ingenie. Their products and services have proved insightful and robust, and have evolved with markets as diverse as vehicle tracking, all aspects of fleet management, and most latterly the demands of monetising the connected vehicle.",

The combination of the Redtail VAM with their DataWarehouse data storage and device management solution is a winning combination that takes the effort out of driver data acquisition.",

        "With the second stolen truck we could track its route and all of its stops around Oklahoma City. In 20/20 hindsight we could have set a geo-fence around it and probably nabbed the thief. But it turned out to be a good move just taking our truck back when we did - because a tornado ripped through that neighborhood a couple of days later, and we would have lost it if wed waited. The Redtail GPS tracking works really well for stolen vehicle recovery. We love it Im putting one on my restored 79 Trans Am.",

        "Our company sells and erects pre-engineered steel buildings and we run a small fleet. Im very happy with Redtail GPS. I saved enough in the first week to pay for the tracker and service after terminating three drivers who were late for work, falsifying timesheets and making unauthorized use of the vehicle. The remaining employees are more productive now just knowing that we use Redtail. Its very user-friendly and easy to install. We don’t get great cell coverage where we are but it’s been Johnny on the spot. It showed me both addresses at a job site based on where the truck was parked: it’s that precise! I use it with my iPad and plan to order another unit. Highly recommended.",
